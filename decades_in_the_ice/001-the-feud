The Feud (broken Villanelle)

In the beginning was a symbol in an ape's hand.
In the end there is the great intelligent beetle, and the asteroid.
Between you and I there is a breach of space, 
of time, of gods or lack thereof?
Well, I question that.

Twisted infinities 
and the net remembers 
and I am that. 

So, in the beginning was a symbol in an ape's hand.

Parted, already parted!

Abandon, the foul word!

Between you and I there is a breach of space, 
of time, of gods or lack thereof.

When I entered the invisible college, I abjured the gods, 
though it was not required.  I thought: why not.

And so this is my father's black sword, Oathbreaker, that drinks men's souls.

In the beginning was a symbol in an ape's hand.

You would not speak the word, 
though it had been written on the stone of moss-covered temples and
in the clay strata below 
the earliest mammoth bones.

It is just a word and yet,
to accept the word as only word, has a significance.
Perhaps you missed that.  Anyway, we misunderstood each other.

In the beginning was a symbol in an ape's hand.

Between you and I there is a breach, 
of space, of time, of gods or lack thereof.
