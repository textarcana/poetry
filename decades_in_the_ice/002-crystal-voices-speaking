"I miss my friends, I miss my wife. It's lonely out in space."  --Elton John

I burned the scroll
when you said you were in love
I hear the old man's words still in my mind

I hear a lot of things in my mind
but when I fell into that airlock
I burned the scroll

I forgot what I had promised
there was only the cold awesome life-giving battery
I hear the old man's words still in my mind

crystal voices speaking
it is a long fall back to Earth
I burned the scroll

so many atmospheres at speed
I'm afraid of splashdown
I hear the old man's words still in my mind

it's not the world that I miss
it's the world that I miss
I burned the scroll
I hear the old man's words still in my mind
