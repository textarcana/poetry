No God

So you turned out
to be wrong 
and your God

was missing after all
So what?

We got drunk,
we missed God.

We celebrated Christmas for a few more years, then stopped.
And out between the planets
we survived in our small ship
for almost a generation

And your God,
this asteroid, our home

there was a prophecy 
but you abandoned it
