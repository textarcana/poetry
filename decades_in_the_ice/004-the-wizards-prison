The Wizard's Prison

It was
wrong --
less than
sane.

Wrong
things were
sane.

Said
things...  Were
you?  Should have
said,
referenced those tragic myths.  Not --
you should have --
saturday morning cartoons.  But
referenced, those tragic myths (not,
I get it,
saturday morning cartoons) but
I got it later.

I get it.

The nostalgia
(I got it later)
was a learned thing.

The nostalgia
for me
was a learned thing.

All your human customs...

For me
you are a strange
(all your human customs)
species.

You are a strange
but generous
species,
and tolerant
but generous
and patient
and tolerant.

I am sorry 
and patient.

Anyway, the first time I touched the right tools
(I am sorry,
I should not have)
anyway, the first time I touched the right tools
opened that rift.

I should not have
you, in your crystal maze.

Opened that rift,
me in my dirigible,
you in your crystal maze.

Only the obelisk 
(me in my dirigible)
could bring us back.

Only the obelisk.
To a space and time,
could bring us back,
fortunately we found it.

To a space and time
inscribed around
(fortunately we found it)
the extreme terminal point.

Inscribed around 
were the words
(the extreme terminal point)

"I am sorry for opening that rift"

were the words

"I should not have used the master's tools
I am sorry for opening that rift
I wanted to understand
I should not have used the master's tools
but in the end all
I wanted to understand
I understood I caused it
but in the end all
if I could undo
I understood I caused it
if I could unlearn
if I could undo
but instead I will guard the doorway
if I could unlearn
here inside the obelisk
but instead I will guard the doorway
less than
here inside the obelisk."

It was.
