The Crossroads (broken Villanelle)
Sun Nov  7 04:25:43 2010

Shadow and the 
cats with rain
too abstracted

to explain.
Filter filth and
future flying...

Each decision 
spawns and kills 
an infinite number of small decisions.

Too abstracted.

Live somewhere you can see the stars.
Listen at night for the ground speaking.

Draw the circle, 
speak to the four directions,

Carry wood, for pointing the way,
carry a knife to tap the bell.
Carry a bell.
