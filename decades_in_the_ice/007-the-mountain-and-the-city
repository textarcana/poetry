What Does It Feel Like To Be Home?
Mon Nov 15 00:04:08 2010


It is cold in the hotel room, 
the bird-headed-avatar-drawn-
over-the-doorway room.  

The bird-headed river water 
and sky over the doorway and 
street and land.

River water and sky.

The streetlights are fire.

And street, 
and land, 
I stood 
at the window.  
The streetlights 
are fire.

Before I could draw, 
I stood at the window. 

Something like what I used to render 
before I could draw.

Avatar drawn something 
like what I used to render.

It is cold in the hotel.

under the twitching lines
dismally the edged flowed
to the left, shadows lined
outer banks shining

the cleft between mountains
navigated across those lakes
the turning back compass
red light, rolling hills, low sound over the valley

in a wilderness we climb -- easily it brings ice
the white owl on the gate post in the dark
pausing and leaping in the headlights

I hung within a cloud
and turned toward what I thought was eternal
translated in my head

magic is the art of adjusting one's own perceptions of things
to convince, to distract, to misdirect, to guide
one must first be a believer
to shift one's own belief, credibly, away from reality

to convince, to distract, to misdirect, to guide
yet to keep at the same time, separately and without wavering
to shift one's own belief, credibly, away from reality
keep in mind that it is perception that shifts, not reality

yet to keep at the same time, separately and without wavering
then the performance is the journey between those two minds
keep in mind that it is perception that shifts, not reality
the left hand points to the mystery

then the performance is the journey between those two minds
while the right hand quickly cuts the cards
the left hand points to the mystery
the flower, the fire

while the right hand quickly cuts the cards
one must first be a believer
the flower, the fire
magic is the art of adjusting one's own perceptions of things

there is no pattern in what the wind does
dogs listen
black night, white snow

tall owl on the gate post
listening
there is no pattern in what the wind does

you were listening also
take this aluminum and plastic miracle
black night, white snow

back to your symbol
moon on high and fir trees in the wind
there is no pattern in what the wind does

everything silver, aluminum, silver again
turning below the blind, impartial
black night, white snow

hear the high, discrete imperfections
even in perfect music, artifacts?
there is no pattern in what the wind does
black night, white snow
