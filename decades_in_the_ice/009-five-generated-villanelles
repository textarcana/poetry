there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson river
the first time I saw it, I stayed drunk for a year
stayed in all winter, learning to draw with my left hand

learned to relax until the left hand drew what the right hand could not:
the implicit patterns in my mind
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson river

over the winter, through the whiskey, I learned these shapes that my secondary hand had learned to draw
shapes that I had learned not to not make
stayed in all winter, learning to draw with my left hand

and when I went down to the Hudson one morning, head pounding, the liquor still leaking out of my pores
I found the river shore by the tracks was covered in broken ice, that the tide had brought in off the frozen river
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson river

in the cold morning through the hangover I was acutely aware that each piece of ice had a different shape
of course
stayed in all winter, learning to draw with my left hand

but all the shapes I had drawn that winter, I found among the various shards of ice
my secret shapes were the shapes of the ice shards off the Hudson
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson river
stayed in all winter, learning to draw with my left hand

there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson
after I saw the shapes in the ice
after I learned that the shapes in my mind could be the shapes in the ice

when already, I had known for a long time that nature draws the same shapes, infinite variations of them
sometimes we call this the fractal character of natural landscapes
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson

before science, people called it the hand of God
as if God would stoop to having His own personal style
after I learned that the shapes in my mind could be the shapes in the ice

I knew then that I had found the left hand path
Blake said: the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson

I drew with my left hand and drank the umber liquor all winter
and it was winter for many years
after I learned that the shapes in my mind could be the shapes in the ice

when I saw the shapes in the ice, I knew that I would take the left hand path, the one that leads to the palace of excess (I mean, the palace of wisdom)
what I said there in the ice by the train tracks in the early morning, I said in my mind
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson
after I learned that the shapes in my mind could be the shapes in the ice

there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson
when I found the shapes that I had drawn
late at night, all the time, until I could do it as automatically as Austin Spare

then for a moment I felt victory, that I had mastered some innate pattern language that is in nature
but then I passed forever through the surface of this moment, into the core realization and there was my own mortality
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson

but I was never again afraid when I sensed a secret braille in the patterns of the geese as the flocks landed on the half-frozen surface of the river
and I accepted finally that there are languages one only reads in the dark, feeling along with the fingers of the mind
late at night, all the time, until I could do it as automatically as Austin Spare

that morning I walked back to town, to the house where I had been drinking, to the room with red walls with the red couch where I fell asleep
in the previous autumn I had made a bet with a woman that I could stay another year in that town
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson

I lost that wager, but it took me many years to pay
the left hand path was open, the palace of wisdom awaited, I thought if I stayed by the banks of the Hudson scribbling automatically like Spare, that I would never stop drinking whiskey and that I would die too soon
late at night, all the time, until I could do it as automatically as Austin Spare

it took many years to pay the debt
too long to circle back to the Hudson's shores, to once again read the patterns in the flocks of water birds
there is a deep and abiding spirituality in the Hudson
late at night, all the time, until I could do it as automatically as Austin Spare

I have never faltered in that quest
although I have been a vanishing friend and a mercurial adversary
I stayed true to Austin Spare and Mercea Eliade

or I kept the spirit of what I thought they meant
I never tried to see the world through clear eyes, the world is only seen through smoke and the automatic representations of an exhausted and somewhat drunken hand
I have never faltered in that quest

Blake knew this, and nature teaches that also
whatever you make, where ever you go
I stayed true to Austin Spare and Mercea Eliade

you can do no better than the shapes in the ice
in the end, you will make the shapes that nature makes
I have never faltered in that quest

because you are nature, no more no less
the drunken doodlings of a random hand
I stayed true to Austin Spare and Mercea Eliade

whatever you make, wherever you go, you will do no better than nature herself 
because you are her, nothing more, nothing less
I have never faltered in that quest
I stayed true to Austin Spare and Mercea Eliade

my father would tell me: we don't believe in cemeteries in this family.
my mother and my father (your grandparents)
I scattered their ashes in the ocean when they died

he asked me to do the same thing with his ashes
but I didn't.  That's how it is to be the son of a wizard
my father would tell me: we don't believe in cemeteries in this family.

some of the things you get asked to do, you can't 
anyway, I was only a  son, when what my father wanted was an apprentice
I scattered their ashes in the ocean when they died

I tried to be the best apprentice I could be
when the trick goes wrong, how does the magician recover?
my father would tell me: we don't believe in cemeteries in this family.

that last vanishing act was too much for my father
every year at midnight, on the anniversary
I scattered their ashes in the ocean when they died

we wrap a black dagger in black silk and throw it into the Hudson river at midnight
his sword I took and I broke, let it lie forever unused, in a corner of the lab
my father would tell me: we don't believe in cemeteries in this family.
I scattered their ashes in the ocean when they died
