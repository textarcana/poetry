Odysseus

when I met the man 
who mistook my oar for a winnowing fan
I knew I had traveled far enough inland

the sanity made me sick
I needed to return to the sea
to my cruel island, where later I'd kill with my compound bow
contemptuously and with many sharp arrows

give me back disguises and cunning and witchery
enough of dust, walking, crops swaying under the noon sun
it is the smell of the grave
the stale smell of earth

give me the sea, shifting ever
mindless the wheat plants' roots digging deeper into the black soil

I followed what the seer said
tho he was sick with eating mold
the wheels of fire only in his head
I visited the land of the dead

and asked the questions Man Was Not Meant to Ask
I walked until I met someone
who mistook my oar for a winnowing fan

and then I came back
and shot my competitors
with the cruel arrows of contempt, also sharpened iron

the floor of my hall was red
in my mind danced the faces of the witches
and the generals I had followed
