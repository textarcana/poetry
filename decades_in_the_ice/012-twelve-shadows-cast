Twelve shadows cast

Twelve shadows exist
Idiotically in the ivory of 
Self: obviated, trivialized, 
Bequeathed below the surface.

The whale waits 
In triumph, of the krill.

We'll shadow the fish.
We'll fix the iron implement 
Indefinitely in the stars 

We'll draw a map, 
A constellation guide.

We'll indent it.

And fortunately
It won't fit.

So again
The thing is that
There is no thing
And that.
